# Intermediate Webpage

This project demonstrates intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, focusing on form creation, validation, responsive layouts, and DOM manipulation. It combines a contact form with a dynamic image gallery to fulfill the project objectives.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

    integrated-webpage/
        ├── index.html
        ├── styles.css
        ├── script.css
        └── Readme.md


*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the webpage, containing the structure and content.
*   `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage's appearance.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that provides the dynamic functionality, such as adding and deleting images in the gallery.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone or download the project files.
2.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Functionality

The webpage consists of two main sections:

*   **Image Gallery:** Users can add images to the gallery by entering the image URL in the input field and clicking the "Add Image" button. Each image is displayed with a delete button that allows users to remove it from the gallery.
*   **Contact Form:** Users can submit their contact information and message through the form. The form includes fields for name, email, contact number, LinkedIn profile URL, and message.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML: The markup language used to structure the content of the webpage.
*   CSS: The stylesheet language used to style the appearance of the webpage.
*   JavaScript: The programming language used to add interactivity to the webpage.

## Further Enhancements

*   Implement form validation to ensure users enter valid data in the contact form.
*   Allow users to upload images directly from their device instead of just entering URLs.
*   Add a lightbox functionality to display images in a larger format when clicked.
*   Make the webpage responsive to different screen sizes.
